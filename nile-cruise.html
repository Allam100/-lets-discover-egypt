        You will be picked up from your hotel by your private driver and representative and taken to the port on the Nile River (the longest river in the world and the main source of life for Egypt). Board the luxurious boat and enjoy a few hours of wonderful Egyptian food, mesmerizing belly dancers and whirling Dervish dancers (Tannoura), enchanting music, live band and the lovely breeze on the River Nile. Take pictures of the show and of the wonderful nightly view of the illuminated city of Cairo from the top-deck. Once the cruise is over you will be driven back to your hotel.
